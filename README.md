# Fashion MNIST CNN

My implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for the [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) benchmark.

I've built this in preparation for the [Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/) course on Udemy and improved it based on the course material.

It achieves an accuracy of **92.7%** after training for **5 epochs**.

## Usage

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mauvm/fashion-mnist-cnn --depth=1
```

Then download the Fashion MNIST dataset from Kaggle:

1. Register on kaggle.com
2. Search for "Fashion MNIST" (by Zalando Research)
3. Click on download and extract in `large_files` folder next to the folder of this repository

Run this in your [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) shell to download all the prerequisites:

```bash
conda create --name fashion-mnist-cnn
conda activate fashion-mnist-cnn
conda install tensorflow numpy pandas
```

Next up, train the model (runs for 20 epochs):

```bash
python train.py
# Epoch 1/5
# 60000/60000 [==============================] - 246s 4ms/sample - loss: 0.5674 - acc: 0.8041
# Epoch 2/5
# 60000/60000 [==============================] - 248s 4ms/sample - loss: 0.3157 - acc: 0.8855
# Epoch 3/5
# 60000/60000 [==============================] - 247s 4ms/sample - loss: 0.2597 - acc: 0.9063
# Epoch 4/5
# 60000/60000 [==============================] - 246s 4ms/sample - loss: 0.2248 - acc: 0.9185
# Epoch 5/5
# 60000/60000 [==============================] - 242s 4ms/sample - loss: 0.1932 - acc: 0.9303
```

Finally test the model:

```bash
python test.py
# 10000/10000 [==============================] - 5s 453us/sample - loss: 0.2025 - acc: 0.9268
# Loss 0.20249984654188155
# Accuracy 0.9268
```

See [config.py](./config.py) and [model.py](./model.py) for the configuration and model.
